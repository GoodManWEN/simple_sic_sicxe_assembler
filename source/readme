    This archive contains software to accompany the text "System Software: An
    Introduction to Systems Programming".  There is a SIC simulator and a 
    simple assembler, loader, and bootstrap for SIC. This software is written
    in standard Pascal, and should run with (at most) very minor changes on 
    almost any machine with a Pascal compiler.
 
    The following files are included: 
 
      SICSIM.PAS  SIC simulator source program (Pascal)
      SICSIM.DOC  Instructions for installing and using the SIC simulator 
 
      SICASM.PAS  SIC assembler source program (Pascal)
      SICASM.DOC  Instructions for installing and using the SIC assembler 
 
      SICLDR.ASM  SIC loader source program (SIC assembler language)
      SICLDR.OBJ  SIC loader object code
      SICLDR.DOC  Instructions for installing and using the SIC loader 
 
      SICBOOT.ASM SIC bootstrap source program (SIC assembler language)
      SICBOOT.OBJ SIC bootstrap object code
      SICBOOT.DOC Instructions for installing and using the SIC bootstrap 
 
      SICTEST.DOC Description of SIC software test run 
      SICTEST.ASM Source program for SIC software test run
      SICTEST.OBJ Object program for SIC software test run
      SICTEST.DAT Input data for SIC software test run
 
 
    You should begin by listing and reading the appropriate documentation 
    files (SICSIM.DOC, SICASM.DOC, SICLDR.DOC, SICBOOT.DOC, SICTEST.DOC). 
    These files contain further instructions for the installation and use 
    of the software.
