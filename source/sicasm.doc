                     INSTALLING THE SIC ASSEMBLER
 
 
     The SIC assembler is written in standard Pascal. It should be possible 
     to install this assembler on almost any computer with a Pascal compiler,
     by making the minor changes described below. 
 
 INPUT AND OUTPUT 
 
     All of the ASSIGN statements are located in the main procedure 
     (lines 1499-1502). These statements may need to be changed
     (or removed) if your system uses some other means for 
     associating internal and external file names.  Similarly, the
     CLOSE statements (lines 1439, 1485-1487) may need to be changed
     or removed.
 
 CHARACTER CODES
 
     The SIC machine uses ASCII character codes. Therefore, the 
     assembler must convert from the character codes used by the host
     machine to the ASCII equivalent in order to assemble character
     string constants. The information needed to do this translation 
     is supplied in the array named ascii; initialization statements
     for this array begin at line 1591. 
 
     If the host machine uses ASCII character codes, the only
     initialization needed is the statement
 
              for i := 0 TO 255 do ascii[i] := i;
 
     If the host machine uses a different set of character codes,
     initialization is performed with a series of statements of
     the form 
 
             ascii[h] := a; 
 
     where 'h' is the ordinal value for some character on the host 
     computer, and 'a' is the ordinal value for the same character 
     in the ASCII character set.

                      HOW TO USE THE SIC ASSEMBLER 
 
 
   This is a simple assembler for SIC (standard version). It uses the
   following external files:
 
        SRCFILE -- the source program to be assembled 
        OBJFILE -- the object program generated by the assembly
        LISFILE -- the assembly listing
        INTFILE -- intermediate working file for the assembler.
 
   The assembler supports all standard SIC features and instructions, 
   and the assembler directives START, END, BYTE, WORD, RESB, RESW.
 
   General information about the SIC instructions and assembler directives
   can be found in "System Software" (Chapter 2 and Appendix A). 
   Implementation conventions and restrictions for this assembler are
   described below.
 
 SOURCE FORMAT
 
   The source program to be assembled must be in fixed format as follows:
 
       Bytes  1-8  Label
                9  Blank
             10-15 Operation code (or Assembler directive) 
             16-17 Blank
             18-35 Operand
             36-66 Comment
 
   Imbedded blanks are not allowed in the Label, Operation code, or 
   Operand fields (except within a character string in a BYTE directive).
   If a source line contains a period (.) in the first byte, the entire
   line is treated as a comment.
 
 
 CHARACTER SET
 
   Source program statements may be written using either uppercase or
   lowercase letters.
 
 
 
 INSTRUCTION OPERANDS 
 
   Instruction operands may be either a symbol (which appears as a label
   in the program), or an actual hexadecimal address (4 hex digits or less).
   Hexadecimal addresses that would begin with 'A' through 'F' must start
   with a leading '0' (to distinguish them from labels). Either type of 
   operand may be followed by ',X' to indicate indexed addressing.
 
 
 START STATEMENT
 
   The first statement in the source program (except for comment lines)
   must be START. No other START statements may appear in the program.
   The operand for START is a hexadecimal address (4 hex digits or less),
   which is taken as the starting address for the program.
 
 
 END STATEMENT
 
   The last statement in the source program should be END. The operand
   for END must be a symbol which appears as a label in the program. 
 
 
 BYTE STATEMENT 
 
   The operand for a BYTE statement must be of the form C'ccc...' or 
   X'hhh...', as described in "System Software." The maximum length
   of the operand is 15 characters or 14 hex digits (representing 7 bytes).
 
 
 WORD STATEMENT 
 
   The operand for a WORD statement may be either a symbol (which appears
   as a label in the program) or a decimal integer (4 digits or less).
   Integers may be preceded by a minus sign (-) to indicate negative 
   values. 
 
 
 RESB AND RESW STATEMENTS 
 
   The operand for RESB or RESW should be a non-negative decimal integer
   (4 digits or less). 
 
 
 ADDRESS LIMITATION 
 
   The maximum address handled or displayed by the assembler is FFFF.
