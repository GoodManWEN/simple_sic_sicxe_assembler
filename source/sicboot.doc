                        INSTALLING THE SIC BOOTSTRAP 
 
 
    The only installation required is to place the object code for the 
    bootstrap (from file SICBOOT.OBJ) in file DEV00 for use by the 
    SIC simulator. The source code for the bootstrap is included in 
    case you wish to modify the bootstrap.
 
    To modify the bootstrap, make the desired changes and assemble the 
    source code. The resulting object program must then be edited so
    that it is in the proper form to be loaded by the S(TART command of 
    the SIC simulator. To do this, first remove the Header and End 
    records, and the first 9 characters of each Text record (the 'T',
    starting address, and length). The remaining object code must then 
    be packed into four records. Each such record should contain exactly
    64 characters (representing 32 bytes of object code), with no headers
    or other control information. If the object code for the bootstrap
    does not completely fill the four 64-character records, it must be 
    padded with 0's.
 
    In making modifications to the bootstrap, note that the object code 
    for the bootstrap can be no more than 128 bytes long. Notice also 
    that this object code must occupy contiguous memory locations, beginning 
    at address 0. Thus, any statements which do not generate object code 
    (such as RESB and RESW) must appear at the end of the bootstrap.

                    HOW TO USE THE SIC BOOTSTRAP 
 
 
    The bootstrap reads object code from file DEVF1 and enters it into
    memory starting at address 80 (hexadecimal). After all of the code from 
    DEVF1 has been loaded, the bootstrap executes a jump to address 80
    to begin the execution of the program just loaded. (Normally, this
    program will be the SIC loader.) 
 
    Each byte of object code is represented on file DEVF1 as two hexadecimal 
    digits (just as it is in a Text record of a SIC object program). 
    However, there is no header or other control information (addresses,
    lengths, etc.). The object code from DEVF1 is always loaded into
    consecutive bytes of memory, beginning at address 80.
 
    The file DEVF1 should contain only characters that represent valid
    hexadecimal digits (0-9 or A-F). However, the object code may be 
    divided into two or more lines for convenience in creation and 
    editing.
 
    To use the SIC bootstrap, place the object code for the bootstrap in
    file DEV00 and the object code for the program to be loaded (in the
    format described above) in file DEVF1. (Normally, this will be the
    code for the SIC loader, which is already supplied in the proper
    format.) Then run the SIC simulator and execute the S(tart command.
