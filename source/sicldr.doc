                         INSTALLING THE SIC LOADER 
 
 
    The only installation required is to place the object code for the 
    loader (from file SICLDR.OBJ) into the file DEVF1 for use by the 
    simulator. The source code for the loader (SICLDR.ASM) is included in
    case you wish to make modifications to the loader.
 
    To modify the loader, make the desired changes and assemble the 
    source code. The resulting object program must then be edited so
    that it is in the proper form to be loaded by the bootstrap.
    To do this, remove the Header and End records, and the first 9 
    characters of each Text record (the 'T', address, and length). 
 
    In making modifications to the loader, note that the object code 
    must occupy contiguous memory locations, beginning at address 80. 
    Thus, any statements which do not generate object code (such as
    RESB and RESW) must appear at the end of the loader.

                         HOW TO USE THE SIC LOADER 
 
 
    This is an absolute loader that loads object programs in the format 
    that is described in Section 2.1 of "System Software." The object
    program is read from file DEVF2. After the program is loaded, the 
    loader jumps to the indicated starting address to begin execution. 
 
    To run the loader, place the object program to be loaded in file 
    DEVF2, the object code for the loader in file DEVF1, and the
    object code for the SIC bootstrap in file DEV00. Then run the 
    SIC simulator and execute the S(tart command. 
 
    Errors in the object program being loaded will result in an error 
    halt by the loader (on an illegal instruction trap).
